== Building code
The install is for Linux only. You need Java and Scala pre-installed.

For Java, OpenJDK is fine, and can be installed by package. Or download an Oracle jar file and put it someplace. For Scala, packages are not so reliable. Scala has always moved fast, and packaging doesn't keep up. However, this project uses simple Scala code, so should work even with old versions of Scala. On the whole, a download of Scala may cause less problems. Then put it on your path. Urrgh. See below, follow the same instructions as installing the project itself.

 
== If you have a build tool

=== To update SSC
Build the project, produce a jar.

Make a folder called ''tml', with subfolders ''tml/bin' and ''tml/lib'. Put the jar in ''tml/lib' and the launch script (from /tools) in ''tml/bin'.



== Build using the script

=== To install SSC
Navigate a terminal into the top folder. Run,

./make_compile_and_jar


This should create a folder called ''/tml' inside the folder. It has a compiled and jar'ed executable, with supplementary folders. The folder can half-installed.


=== Reminder instructions for a half-install
Move the project ''tml' folder to wherever you keep Java code.

Adjust the top of the project script to point at your choice of Scala installation (and Java, if necessary).

Put the folder on the computer's path.


== Appending to a system Path
Put a folder in the operating systems $PATH so the commandline can find it. To see your path,

echo $PATH

Find .bashrc, usually in your home folder. If you have a Debian-based system the location of .bashrc depends on development philosophy one long-ago frosty morning. Try  ~/.bash_profile. Or even just creating .bashrc and see if it works. Or swapping operating sytems for someone that will tell you what they are doing.

Add or ammend to .bashrc like this (note the lack of spaces. bash is not fond of spaces),

PATH=/<path to...>/tml/bin:$PATH

or use,

/etc/profile

for all users. 

The path declaration needs to be followed by,

export path

preconfigured .bashrc files (e.g. Debian) have that already.

 
(you can export 

PATH=$PATH:/home/someUserName/Websites/someSiteFolder

from the commandline, but it won't persist)



== Restart bash
In every terminal to be used, run,

source ~/.bashrc

Or restart the whole computer... but in the middle of development, that's a pain.



=== Adjust the script
The project script launcher doesn't try to 'scala' the jar, it runs Java with Scala as a library (more flexible).

You need to tell the script where to find Scala. In the script, point this variable,
 
SCALA_HOME="/path/to/my/chosen/scala/folder"

at the folder containing Scala executables (which should contain /lib and /bin).

Don't be tempted to add formatting, especially spaces! This is BASH! It will scorn you!

You can also point at another Java, in the same way, using,

JAVA_HOME="/path/to/my/chosen/jdk"

...but most people will not need that.
